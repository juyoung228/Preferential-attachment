In an image file, 
x axis means 'age of citation'.
ex) 10 = a paper is cited from 1 to 10 year after being published.

In addition, the values for coloring are absolute values of (Preferential Attachment value-1)
So, 0 denotes that the PA value of the cell is exactly 1.

* The white(blank) cell shows that there is no data in the cell.
For example, in 2015, there was no paper that cited a paper which had published 100~110 years ago.
It is interesting that Electrical engineering & computer science domain has a few blank cells.
